# MycroDB ðŸ“¦

[![Logo](/public/logo.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mycro-db)

## Project Overview ðŸš€

MycroDB is a JavaScript library for managing Document Databases stored in a single JSON file or in-memory.

## Installation

To use MycroDB in your project, you can install it via npm (or other package managers):

```shell
npm install mycro-db
```

## MycroDB API

To get started, import the 'MycroDatabase' class, along with a 'Storage' class, and initialize the two new objects:

```javascript
import { JsonStorage, MemoryStorage, MycroDatabase } from 'mycro-db';

// in-memory only mode
const inMemoryStorage = new MemoryStorage();
const db = new MycroDatabase(inMemoryStorage);

// json file mode
const jsonStorage = new JsonStorage('my_database.json');
const db = new MycroDatabase(jsonStorage);
```

### Collections API

To keep data organized, the library works with a collections structure. Use collections to 'logically' divide your data.

#### Define a Collection

To create a collection, you must provide a name, and optionally, you can pass a model (use an object with properties and their values being their types) to help the IDE with intellisense.

```javascript
const User = db.collection('users', { name: String(), age: Number() });
```

#### Insert a Document into a Collection

To insert a document into a collection, you need to provide a plain JavaScript object with values compatible with JSON.

You can insert one or more documents in a single operation by passing a array of document objects.

```javascript
User.insert([
    { name: 'Alice', age: 28 },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }
]);
```

#### Update a Document in a Collection

To update a document, you should pass an object containing the 'id' key with the value of the document's ID to be updated, along with the 'data' key containing an object with the 'key: value' pair that will be updated in the document.

The update is atomic, meaning that only the values provided in the object will be updated, while the other values in the document remain unchanged.

You can update one or more documents in a single operation by passing a array of document objects.

```javascript
User.update([
    { id: 1, data: { age: 45 } }
]);
```

#### Get a Document in a Collection

To get a document from a collection, you should provide a ID of the document.

You can get one or more documents in a single operation by passing a array of IDs.

```javascript
User.get([
    1, 5
]);
```

#### Query Documents in a Collection

To query documents in a collection, you should provide a strategy (filter) function. If no filtering function is provided, all documents will be returned.

The quantity of documents returned depends on the 'limit' parameter. Offset parameter is used for 'pagination'.

All parameters are optional. By default, the limit is 25, the offset is 0.

```javascript
const strategy = (user) => user.age > 21;
const limit = 10;
const offset = 0;

User.query(strategy, limit, offset);
```

#### Remove a Document from a Collection

To remove a document, you should provide a list of IDs.

You can remove one or more documents in a single operation by passing a array of IDs.

```javascript
User.remove([
    1, 5
]);
```

## Next Steps

We're planning to:

- ðŸ“¦ Expand the range of Storage strategies.
- ðŸ§¹ Implement a data caching system and indexing for specific Collection keys.
